# KinetiqAI
### AI-Powered Personalized Physiotherapy Recovery System

KinetiqAI is an intelligent physiotherapy recovery platform that helps users recover from common injuries through **personalized exercise plans, daily feedback adaptation, AI-assisted guidance, and gamified motivation**.

Built for smarter rehabilitation, the system adjusts recovery plans based on:
- injury type
- pain level
- activity level
- progress history
- recurring injury severity

---

## 🚀 Overview

KinetiqAI is designed to make physiotherapy more **accessible, adaptive, and engaging**.

Instead of static recovery plans, the platform creates **dynamic, personalized exercise programs** that evolve based on the user’s daily progress and pain feedback.

It combines:
- **AI-assisted exercise planning**
- **progress tracking**
- **daily adaptation**
- **gamification**
- **chatbot support**

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. User Registration & Login
Users can create an account and securely log in.

### 2. Profile Setup
Users enter:
- age
- injury type
- pain level
- activity level

### 3. Plan Generation
The backend creates a personalized recovery plan using rule-based logic.

### 4. Daily Progress Logging
Users submit feedback after sessions:
- pain level
- completion percentage
- difficulty

### 5. Plan Adaptation
The system modifies the next plan based on recovery performance.

### 6. Gamified Motivation
Users earn XP, levels, streaks, and badges as they progress.

## 🧠 Recovery Logic

KinetiqAI uses rule-based adaptive physiotherapy logic.

### Pain-Based Filtering
- **High pain (7–10):** only beginner-safe exercises
- **Medium pain (4–6):** low to moderate difficulty
- **Low pain (1–3):** broader progression based on activity level

### Recurring Injury Handling
If a user recovers and later restarts the same injury:
- intensity is reduced
- only beginner-safe movements are prioritized
- progression becomes more cautious

### Volume Personalization
Exercise reps and sets are adjusted using:
- age
- pain severity
- activity level
- recovery cycle

---

## 🎮 Gamification System

The app includes a motivational recovery layer with:

### XP Rewards
Users earn XP based on session completion.

### Levels
Progression stages include:
- Beginner
- Recovering
- Improving
- Strong
- Fully Fit

### Badges
Example achievements:
- First Step
- Hat Trick
- Week Warrior
- Century
- Legend

### Streak Tracking
Encourages consistent daily rehabilitation.
